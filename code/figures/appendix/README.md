# Appendix figures (Figures 3–11)

```bash
bash code/figures/appendix/run_all.sh        # writes figures/figure_*.pdf, about 45 s on CPU
python3 code/figures/appendix/fig05_boundaries.py /tmp/fig3.pdf   # one figure, any output path
```

Tested with the versions pinned in [requirements.txt](../../../requirements.txt) (numpy 2.2.6,
scipy 1.15.3, matplotlib 3.10.5); the output is identical to the figures in the paper. The script
file names keep the numbering of an earlier draft; the "figure" column gives the paper's numbers.

- `paper_tex/` holds the LaTeX of the paper's appendix sections and of main Tables 1–2. The
  scripts parse the numbers they plot from it, so a figure cannot drift from the printed tables.
- `record_tables/` holds three tables of the fuller record that the appendix condenses (all eight
  correctness patterns, the reference corrections each policy loses or keeps, and the same-target
  baselines with their component latencies). They use the earlier word "omit" for "skip".
- Every script recomputes intervals and p-values from counts, checks the numbers against the other
  tables and against the records where a released CSV exists, asserts the claims the appendix
  makes about the figure, and stops with an `AssertionError` if anything disagrees. Figures 4, 7,
  9, 10 and 11 also check their own layout (label clearances) and stop if a label would collide.

"""Verification (c): rebuild one Table 2 row - large/ARC/Text - from the released
per-question development records, and check it gives 95.0% skipped and 9/284 changed.

Routing rule (configs/confidence_boundaries/frozen_config.json, mode "selective"):
a question is answered by the receiver alone (the reference call is skipped) when
its ProbeMax is at or below the frozen deployed threshold; otherwise the reference
is called. "changed" counts the skipped questions whose stored reference answer
differs from the stored receiver-only answer - the conditional risk of skipping.

Inputs (all released in this repository):
  configs/confidence_boundaries/deployments/large_arc_T.json        q and threshold
  splits/development_and_calibration/arc_dev_representatives.json   dev ids
  records/boundaries_large_small/records/large_arc_dev_probes.jsonl.gz   ProbeMax
  records/answer_parser_v2/labels/full_development_P2_SCORING_V2.jsonl.gz  o_R, o_T

Run from the repository root:  python3 verify/verify_c_table2_row.py
